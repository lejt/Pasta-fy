    {name: "Angel Hair (Capellini)", desc: `According to Oretta Zanini De Vita’s 2009 Encylopedia of Pasta, angel hair—sometimes called capelli d’angelo—was first recorded in Rome as early as the 17th century as a specialty of convents. It was made by rolling an egg-based pasta dough out into a thin sheet, then cutting it into even thinner noodles. Nuns would send the pasta in broth to new mothers in ailing health, as it was easy to digest. It was food for infants, too, since it didn’t require much chewing.`,

    {name: "Bow Tie (Farfalle)", desc: `Farfalle pasta is actually one of the oldest pasta shapes. It originated during the 16th century in Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna, where it is also known as ‘strichetti’. I have read that in Emilia, strichetti (today’s farfalle) were invented by housewives wanting to use up extra pasta dough left over from making filled cappelletti pasta. Apparently, once the filling ran out, the women of the region used up the remaining dough by making farfalle. This habit became so popular that they would actually make extra dough so that there would be plenty leftover to make farfalle!`,

    {name: "Bucatini", desc: `This cut is like spaghetti on the outside but hollow on the inside.   Bucatini’s name is derived from “Buco”, the Italian word for “hole”.  This tubed pasta was invented in an attempt to allow boiling water to cook the pasta from the inside out. Also known as perciatelli, these fragile sticks of semolina were formed by wrapping the dough around a rod, and sliding the metal out. This cut was supposedly invented in the town of Amatrice just northeast of Rome (an area is famous for it’ use of guanciale—cured pork jowls). Even today cured pig jowl is still a common pairing with this cut.  Industrially it is made throughout Italy and overseas as well.`,

    {name: "Cavatappi", desc: `Cavatappi is a generic name adopted by other brands that imitated Barilla's cellentani. This particular shape was born in the 1970s at Barilla in Parma when a set of pasta dies had been mistakenly made with a spiral (instead of straight) set of lines. These produced pasta in a spiral or spring (molla in Italian) shape. Barilla decided to name it after one of the most famous showpeople of the time, Adriano Celentano, who was nicknamed “il molleggiato”. As this name was trademarked by Barilla, other pasta producers had to use a less pop and evocative name like cavatappi (corkscrews).`,

    {name: "Fusilli", desc: `Fusilli is a spiral or corkscrew shaped pasta.  Because of its twists, it has grooves that are good for holding onto sauce. Fusilli pasta were originally developed in Southern Italy by rolling and setting fresh spaghetti around thin rods to dry. This shape is traditionally formed by rolling strips of pasta over a rod to create the twisted shape. Fusilli works well with any sauce, added to soups, or turned into a salad. This shape also bakes well in a casserole.`,

Giulio Giacchero, author of a book on the economy of Genova in 1700s, writes about trenette seasoned with pesto, green beans and potatoes. He says it was the typical festive dish of Ligurian families of the time. In those days, of course, the pasta would have been made mostly by hand and most probably with eggs. But it’s interesting that trenette (or linguine) with pesto, beans and potatoes is still a popular dish in Liguria today.`,

The large surface area and rough texture of the pasta make pappardelle the perfect accompaniment to more robust sauces and ragus. This pasta’s Tuscan origins date back to the 14th century. However, due to their extensive popularity, today pappardelle can be found throughout all regions of Italy. Due to the decadent nature of these strands and the rich sauces that they are usually paired with, pappardelle dishes are often enjoyed in the winter months, or on more traditional ‘feasting days’.`,

Some people believe this specific shape was formed some time between World War I and World War II or between 1914 and 1945. But according to The Pasta Project, it appears the majority of people believe the pasta shape was developed sometime during the 1960s. The period that most people accept as the time frame in which radiatori pasta was created has everything to do with what the pasta resembles. It reminds some of early heating fixtures you'd find nestled in old apartments and homes. To others, it looks just like the radiator grills you'd find on cars of the 1960s. Even though we may never know exactly which year the pasta shape was developed, it remains one of the only pasta shapes to come out of the 20th century.`,

    {name: "Spaghetti", desc: `While some historians believe pasta originated in Italy, most are convinced Marco Polo actually brought it back from his epic voyage to China. The earliest known pasta was made from rice flour and was common in the east. In Italy, pasta was made from hard wheat and shaped into long strands.—bringing this ancient food much closer to modern-day spaghetti. However, the earliest Italian version was likely a bit closer to vermicelli (a pasta name that translates into English as “little worms.”) Spaghetti comes from the word Spago, which translates in English to “string,” or “twine.” In Italy, spaghetti (like all pasta) are generally cooked just to al dente (which means “to the tooth.”) to create a slightly chewy texture, rather than an overly soft consistency.`,

The innkeeper, captivated after watching them, creeps to their room and peeks through the keyhole of the bedroom door. However, all he can see through the keyhole is the naval of Venus. This vision leaves him spellbound – so much so that he immediately rushes to the kitchen and creates a pasta inspired by Venus' navel…and so was born the Tortellini.`,

    desc: `The exact location of Marinara Sauce’s creation seems to be lost to time, but it was likely first developed in the southern region of Italy, in either Naples or Sicily, after tomatoes first appeared in Europe via explorers from the New World in the 16th century. This comes well after the first forms of pasta arrived, which arrived on Italian shores with Arab traders in the 12 century. 
    Tomato sauce is first referenced in the Italian cookbook Lo Scalco alla Moderna (The Modern Steward), written by Italian chef Antonio Latini in 1692. Meanwhile, a recipe for pasta with tomato sauce appears in the 1790 cookbook, L’Apicio Moderno, by chef Francesco Leonardi.
    As for how a particular preparation of tomato sauce came to be known as “marinara,” one needs to look toward the sea. “Marinara” translates to “seafaring”—or colloquially to “sailor style” or “mariner style.” It was given the name marinara not because it was once a seafood-style sauce, but because it was the preferred meal of Italy’s merchants during long expeditions at sea.`},

    In 1891 Pellegrino Artusi published a recipe for a ragù characterized as bolognese in his cookbook. Artusi's recipe, which he called Maccheroni alla bolognese, is thought to derive from the mid 19th century when he spent considerable time in Bologna (maccheroni being a generic term for pasta, both dried and fresh[8]).

Some connect it to pasta cacio e uova, a Neapolitan dish of pasta tossed with melted lard, beaten raw eggs, and cheese, as documented in Ippolito Cavalcanti's 1839 Neapolitan cookbook. Because the name comes from the word carbonaro, “coal burner,” some believe the dish was created as a hearty easy-to-make meal by men working outdoors for long periods. Others trace it to the Allied liberation of Rome in 1944, with American GIs bringing their daily ration of eggs and bacon to local restaurants to add to the limited Italian menu. Supporting this story is the first written reference to the dish in newspaper La Stampa in 1950, describing it as a dish prized by American servicemen.

The second New York-based claim comes from food historians, who posit that the dish was actually invented by James Doty, a Columbia University graduate, who created the dish in the 1980s. As for the Italian origin of the sauce, two separate stories deliver different sides as to who first concocted the creamy sauce in the old world in the 1970s. First, in The Ultimate Pasta Cookbook, author Pasquale Bruno Jr. says vodka sauce was first conjured at a restaurant called Dante in Bologna.

Clams have formed a part of the local diet since ancient times, so it is perhaps no surprise that a clam pasta dish also originated in the city. The first recorded recipe for what we now recognize as spaghetti alle vongole appears in the cookbook Cucina Teorico-pratica, written by Ippolito Cavalcanti, the Duke of Buonvicino, in 1839. His recipe called for just five ingredients—pasta, olive oil, garlic, parsley, and, of course, fresh clams.

So, he left tomato and pecorino, added garlic and removed the bacon, replacing the bucatini with the penne and considerably increased the amount of chilli. We do not know if this is really the history of the arrabbiata but the origin is certainly Roman. Federico Fellini immortalized it in his film Roma, in 1972, together with the rigatoni with the pataja (the intestine of the dairy calf), the carbonara and the snails with mint and chilli. He also appeared in the films La Grande Abbuffata (The Great Binge) by Marco Ferreri of 1973 and in the play Sette chili in sette giorni (Seven pounds in seven days) by Luca Verdone in 1986, with Renato Pozzetto and Carlo Verdone.`},
