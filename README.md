## General Information
This heroku deployed web app contains information on different pasta components and is also a pasta dish generator. Ingredients are separated into four major components of: Pasta, Sauce, Vegetables, and Protein. Browsing the ingredients page allows for the adding of ingredients onto a builds page. Information on individual items can also be seen by clicking and going into the details page. Currently, the details page displays the historical origin of certain ingredients. The builds page contains all the items you have clicked as a user and shows a form to mix and match ingredients. A complete dish can be submitted to be seen on the meals detail page for all users to review.
